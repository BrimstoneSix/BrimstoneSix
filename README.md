- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrimstoneSix
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming, Fishing, Hunting, Working out, and a ton of other hobbies that have no correlation to each other.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code and I am in school for Cybersecurity. The furthur into class I get, the more I like the development side of code. I might switch majors. I'm also learning how NFT art works and how to make some of my own for fun. Not really worried if they sell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to get me started really. Small or large projects, but I'm Super Green at this. So maybe less important parts.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email will work fine or message me here. I'll be hanging aroung more often.
